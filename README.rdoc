= RestfulAdmin

Warning: ALPHA state and mostly BROKEN due to constant Rails codebase change, waiting for 3.1.0 release. Also no tests, use at your own risk.

= Howto

== Add to your Gemfile:

  gem 'restful_admin',  :git => 'git://github.com/pawelpacana/restful_admin'
  gem "rails",          :git => "git://github.com/rails/rails.git"
  gem "arel",           :git => "git://github.com/rails/arel.git"
  gem "rack",           :git => "git://github.com/rack/rack.git"

== In config/routes.rb:

  mount RestfulAdmin::Engine => /admin, :as => 'restful_admin'

== In your models:

  class Event < ActiveRecord::Base
    restful_admin
  end

== Model configuration example:

  restful_admin do |config|
    c.columns_only %w(id title body updated_at)         # show only some columns
    c.columns_except %w(body id)                        # or only some not
    c.columns_additional %w(test)                       # this can be model method
    c.columns_linkified %(title id)                     # which colums are links to show/edit
    c.columns_formatted :body => :textilize             # textilize field before display
    c.columns_excerpted :body => { :characters => 20 }  # show no more than 20 characters
  end
